**Arkanoid-Game**
This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course at Bar-Ilan University. The goal was to design and implement an Arkanoid game using object-oriented principles. I used a GUI implementation that was supplied to us by the course instructors.

*Game Descripition:*
This Arkanoid-like consists of three levels, each one progressively harder than the last. The Player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bouncing balls to destroy the blocks. Completing a level requires breaking all the bricks without letting the ball fall out of the screen.
